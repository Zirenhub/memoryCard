# memoryCard

# Description
memoryCard is a React-built game. The player clicks on a card and the cards change position, game ends if the player clicks the same card twice, and the best score is saved. The game is built using React's component-based architecture for the UI, and hooks for managing the game state and updating the score in real-time.
